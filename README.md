> An intelligent AI-powered copilot that supports call center agents in real-time, maximizing conversion rates and preventing lost sales opportunities.

## 📋 Overview

Call centers handling reservations and sales often lose valuable opportunities when customers hang up before closing deals. This happens due to manual processes, long handling times, and lack of effective follow-up systems. **AI Sales Copilot** is designed to solve this challenge by providing real-time support to human agents and automated post-call interventions to ensure maximum conversion probability.

## 🎯 The Challenge

**Build the Brain Behind Every Conversion**

Design an AI-powered copilot that seamlessly supports the human agent — not replaces them — throughout the entire sales journey.
